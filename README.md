# Atliq-Grands-Financial-Analysis

# Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel chain operating five-star hotels across India for the past 20 years, is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue in the competitive luxury/business hotel sector. This decline is attributed to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making within the management. In a bid to recover, Atliq Grands' management has decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence to regain their market share and revenue. However, due to a lack of an in-house data analytics team, they have outsourced the data analysis to a third-party provider.

# Objective:
The task is to analyze Atliq Grands' historical data and generate actionable insights. This includes:

* Creating Metrics: Calculating and defining KPIs according to the metric list provided by the management team.
* Building a Dashboard: Designing a Power BI dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
* Additional Insights: Identifying relevant insights and trends not specified in the mock-up or metric list, helping Atliq Grands make data-driven decisions to regain market leadership.

# Approach:
The project was approached with the following steps:

* Data Preparation & Modeling:
Structured the provided historical data to align with the business requirements.
Built a clean and efficient data model in Power BI, ensuring relationships between data tables were optimized for accurate calculations and analysis.

Created key metrics like Average Revenue per User (ARPU), Occupancy Rate, Room Category Profitability, Customer Segmentation, and Month-over-Month revenue comparisons, and other important key metrices to assess business performance.

* Dashboard Creation:
Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI, following the mock-up provided by the stakeholders.
Visualized critical KPIs such as occupancy rates, room category profits, revenue per hotel, and customer segmentation trends across different locations.

* Additional Insights:
Provided further analysis beyond the scope of the mock-up by exploring trends in customer demographics, underperforming room categories, and regional revenue share.
Suggested actionable insights for Atliq Grands, including targeting high-revenue customer segments, optimizing room pricing strategies, and identifying key underperforming regions.

* Key Features of the Dashboard:
KPI Visualizations: Interactive visuals displaying revenue, occupancy rates, profit trends, and customer segmentation.
Advanced Filtering: Allows stakeholders to explore data by year, region, customer type, and room category for deeper insights.
Actionable Insights: Highlighted areas where Atliq Grands could improve market positioning, enhance customer retention, and optimize room pricing strategies.
