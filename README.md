# Atliq-Grands-Financial-Analysis

# Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel chain operating five-star hotels across India for the past 20 years, is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue in the competitive luxury/business hotel sector. This decline is attributed to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making within the management. In a bid to recover, Atliq Grands' management has decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence to regain their market share and revenue. However, due to a lack of an in-house data analytics team, they have outsourced the data analysis to a third-party provider.

# Objective:

* Creating Metrics: Calculating and defining KPIs according to the metric list provided by the management team.
* Building a Dashboard: Designing a Power BI dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
* Additional Insights: Identifying relevant insights and trends not specified in the mock-up or metric list, helping Atliq Grands make data-driven decisions to regain market leadership.

Visualized critical KPIs such as occupancy rates, room category profits, revenue per hotel, and customer segmentation trends across different locations.
